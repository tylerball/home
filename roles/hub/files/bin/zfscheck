## ZFS health check script for monit.
## v0.9.0.1
#
## Should be compatible with FreeBSD and Linux. Tested on Ubuntu.
## If you want to use it on FreeBSD then go to Scrub Expired section
## and comment two Ubuntu date lines and uncomment two FreeBSD lines
#
## Assumed usage in monitrc (where 80 is max capacity in percentages
## and 691200 is scrub expiration in seconds):
## check program zfs_health with path "/path/to/this/script 80 691200"
##     if status != 0 then alert
#
## Original script from:
## Calomel.org
##     https://calomel.org/zfs_health_check_script.html
##     FreeBSD ZFS Health Check script
##     zfs_health.sh @ Version 0.17
#
## Main difference from the original script is that this one exits
## with a return code instead of sending an e-mail

# Parameters

maxCapacity=$1 # in percentages
scrubExpire=$2 # in seconds (691200 = 8 days)

usage="Usage: $0 maxCapacityInPercentages scrubExpireInSeconds\n"

if [ ! "${maxCapacity}" ]; then
  printf "Missing arguments\n"
  printf "${usage}"
  exit 1

# probably set the warning closer to 95%.
#
# ZFS uses a copy-on-write scheme. The file system writes new data to
# sequential free blocks first and when the uberblock has been updated the new
# inode pointers become valid. This method is true only when the pool has
# enough free sequential blocks. If the pool is at capacity and space limited,
# ZFS will be have to randomly write blocks. This means ZFS can not create an
# optimal set of sequential writes and write performance is severely impacted.

# on all volumes and all drives using "zpool status". If any non-zero errors
# are reported an email will be sent out. You should then look to replace the
# faulty drive and run "zpool scrub" on the affected volume after resilvering.

# Scrub Expired - Check if all volumes have been scrubbed in at least the last
# 8 days. The general guide is to scrub volumes on desktop quality drives once
# a week and volumes on enterprise class drives once a month. You can always
# use cron to schedule "zpool scrub" in off hours. We scrub our volumes every
# Sunday morning for example.
#
# Scrubbing traverses all the data in the pool once and verifies all blocks can
# be read. Scrubbing proceeds as fast as the devices allows, though the
# priority of any I/O remains below that of normal calls. This operation might
# negatively impact performance, but the file system will remain usable and
# responsive while scrubbing occurs. To initiate an explicit scrub, use the
# "zpool scrub" command.
#
# The scrubExpire variable is in seconds.
